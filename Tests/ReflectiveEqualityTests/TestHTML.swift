    <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:23px\"><strong>Example</strong></p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">To study the efficacy and safety of new drugs, many pharmaceutical companies employ double blind randomized controlled experiments. The dosages, drugs, people who are asked to participate or be control subjects, effects, interventions, and outcomes all depend on the particularities of the study at hand, but the basic premise is that neither the researcher nor the subjects know if they&#8217;re getting the drug or a placebo. This &#8220;double blind&#8221; participation aims to reduce bias and see the true effect of the drug being studied. </p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:23px\"><strong>Plain English</strong></p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Randomized Controlled Experiments are considered the gold standard in research – especially when double blind (meaning neither the subjects nor the researchers know who the control group or the experimental group is). Participants are randomly selected for the to one of two groups and then the results from the experimental group (who receive something) are compared with the results from the control group (who don’t). These procedures are followed mainly to reduce the bias. For the highest quality experiments in pharma, psychology, and other research, randomized controlled experiments are used.</p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-center has-background-dark-background-color has-background\"><strong>Streetlight Effect</strong><br>People tend to get their information from where it’s easiest to look. E.g. the majority of research uses only the sources that appear on the first page of Google search results, regardless of how factual they are. Cumulatively, this can skew an entire field.</p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Some important terms and biases that are important to keep in mind as we discuss Randomized Controlled Experiments include:</p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>The Observer Effect</em></p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Having someone observing changes the phenomenon being observed. We live up to what is expected of us. We don’t often see what we don’t expect to see. The Pygmalion Effect shows us that higher expectations lead to an increase in performance. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat\">Schrödinger’s cat</a> is the famous example that shows we can’t know for sure if cat is alive or dead before opening the box. And, an especially unusual version of the observer effect occurs in quantum mechanics as shown by the double-slit experiment. “Physicists have found that even passive observation of quantum phenomena (by changing the test apparatus and passively ‘ruling out’ all but one possibility), can actually change the measured result. A particularly famous example is the 1998 Weizmann experiment. Despite the “observer” in this experiment being an electronic detector – possibly due to the assumption that the word “observer” implies a person – its results have led to the popular belief that a conscious mind can directly affect reality. The need for the “observer” to be conscious is not supported by scientific research and has been pointed out as a misconception rooted in a poor understanding of the quantum wave function ψ and the quantum measurement process, apparently being the generation of information at its most basic level that produces the effect.” – <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)\">Wikipedia</a></p>

    <p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Proxy</em></p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A stand-in for something else. A variable that is not in itself directly relevant, but that serves in place of an unobservable or immeasurable variable. In order for a variable to be a good proxy, it must have a close correlation, not necessarily linear, with the variable of interest.</p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Selection Bias</em></p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Selection bias is the selection of individuals, groups or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved, thereby ensuring that the sample obtained is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed.</p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias\"><em>Sampling Bias</em></a><em></em></p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The sample is collected in such a way that some members of the intended population are less likely to be included than others.</p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Response Bias</em></p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">People can lie in surveys (i.e., employee engagement surveys…) A wide range of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias\">cognitive biases</a>&nbsp;that influence the responses of participants away from an accurate or truthful response.</p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Nonresponse Bias</em></p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">When people don’t participate in an experiment after they are selected – they fail to respond to the survey</p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p><em><a href=\"http://blas.com/superthinking/\">Super Thinking</a></em> does a great job of laying out how surveys can be influenced:</p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <ul>
       <li>How questions are worded (leading, loaded questions)</li>
       <li>The order of questions, where earlier questions can influence later ones</li>
       <li>Poor or inaccurate memory of respondents</li>
       <li>Difficult representing feelings in a number, such as one to ten ratings</li>
       <li>Respondents reporting things that reflect well on themselves</li>
    </ul>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>The Placebo Effect</em></p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">When patients receive beneficial effects even though no real treatment was administered. For example, in some experiments, patients were either given real medication or sugar pills. In some statistically significant percentage of the time, the patients who received the sugar pill improved drastically. This is caused due to the patient’s belief that the treatment will work rather than the efficacy of the actual treatment</p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\" style=\"font-size:23px\"><strong>Technical Description</strong></p>
    \n\n\n\n
    <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A randomized controlled trial is a type of scientific (often medical) experiment that aims to reduce certain sources of bias when testing the effectiveness of new treatments; this is accomplished by randomly allocating subjects to two or more groups, treating them differently, and then comparing them with respect to a measured response. One group—the experimental group—has the intervention being assessed, while the other—usually called the control group—has an alternative condition, such as a placebo or no intervention. The groups are followed under conditions of the trial design to see how effective the experimental intervention was. Treatment efficacy is assessed in comparison to the control. There may be more than one treatment group or more than one control group. The trial may be blinded, in which information which may influence the participants is withheld until after the experiment is complete. A blind can be imposed on any participant of an experiment, including subjects, researchers, technicians, data analysts, and evaluators. Good blinding may reduce or eliminate some sources of experimental bias. The randomness in the assignment of subjects to groups reduces selection bias and allocation bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments. Blinding reduces other forms of experimenter and subject biases. A well-blinded RCT is often considered the gold standard for clinical trials. Blinded RCTs are commonly used to test the efficacy of medical interventions and may additionally provide information about adverse effects, such as drug reactions. The terms &#8220;RCT&#8221; and &#8220;randomized trial&#8221; are sometimes used synonymously, but the latter term omits mention of controls and can therefore describe studies that compare multiple treatment groups with each other in the absence of a control group. Similarly, the initialism is sometimes expanded as &#8220;randomized clinical trial&#8221; or &#8220;randomized comparative trial&#8221;, leading to ambiguity in the scientific literature. Not all randomized clinical trials are randomized controlled trials (and some of them could never be, as in cases where controls would be impractical or unethical to institute). The term randomized controlled clinical trial is an alternative term used in clinical research; however, RCTs are also employed in other research areas, including many of the social sciences. – <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial\">Wikipedia</a></p>
